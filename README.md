Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE) as a preprocessing step are used in this study to provide a unique method for car number plate detection. The goal is to increase the precision and effectiveness of number plate detection in challenging circumstances. Utilising the powerful learning
capabilities of CNNs and the contrast enhancement capabilities of CLAHE, the proposed solution combines cutting-edge techniques in computer vision and image processing. The method uses CNNs to learn to identify distinguishing aspects of licence plates, enabling precise localization and recognition. Additionally, CLAHE is used as a preprocessing
method to boost contrast in input photos, boosting the visibility of number plates in various lighting situations. The usefulness of the suggested methodology is supported by experimental evaluations on several datasets, which show that it outperforms traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness. It offers promising results
when CNN and CLAHE are used as a preprocessing phase, making it a possible remedy for practical applications involving the detection of car number plates. In conclusion, CNN and CLAHE work together to provide a strong framework for quick and precise car number plate recognition, advancing the fields of computer vision and intelligent 
transportation systems.
